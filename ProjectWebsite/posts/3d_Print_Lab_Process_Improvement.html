            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>While attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute I worked in the 3d print lab. The lab provides students and faculty with access to 27 3d printers, a laser cutter and soldering stations. My job was to take orders for prints from students, and
                stop and start prints. Through this process I found that a large portion of the job was manually copying information from the 3d print management system into a Google Form. This process was required for each order and was quite tedious.
            </p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>I wanted to reduce the amount of time I had to spend on manual data entry.
            </p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>I created a Python program which scrapped information from the 3d print management system, and used user text input to greatly reduce the amount of time required to generate a print order. The program had a command line interface to allow
                for the lab tech to select the student prints to queue and to enter the student’s information. This was the first time that I have been able to apply my self-taught coding skills in the real world. After my supervisor saw the program,
                he asked me to continue development.
            </p>
            <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
            <p>I learned a lot about web scraping through this project, including its limitations. The program required a lot of maintenance to keep up with the 3d print management system’s website updates. I also learned about delivering projects for clients.
                After my supervisor showed interest, I developed a project plan and met biweekly to update him of development progress.
