            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>WPI SWEET (Supporting WPI through Effective and Equitable Teamwork) is a grant-funded program at Worcester Polytech with the purpose of studying and promoting more effective teamwork. Worcester Polytech’s curriculum focuses deeply on project-based
                learning, and this program is one of the ways the school is constantly working to improve its practices. The program is run by a group of professors and students. This group put out a request for a student to build a website to promote
                the program.
            </p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>In our first meeting the project goals were expansive and included a paywall as well as access control through WPI. However the overall goal was the promotion of the group’s research and activities to the WPI community as well as other schools.
            </p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>After the first meeting I created a project proposal which included site functional and nonfunctional requirements, the business need, potential site structure, and questions for future development. Unfortunately a key requirement was that
                the site was closely integrated with the WPI system, this meant that to develop the site I had to use WPI’s official software: EDUBlogs. This is a fork of wordpress which is considerably more limited. As a result, the project goals had
                to be revised because of this technical limitation. Although with numerous conversations with WPI IT and marketing (the two departments which manage the site) I was able to open more features of the edublogs program to meet the needs of
                my client.
            </p>
            <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
            <p>I learned about prioritizing the needs of the client. After discovering the limitations of Edublogs, I presented a few alternative possibilities which would compromise fewer client requirements however It would mean the site did not have a
                wpi.edu url. This url was a top priority for the client, so I worked within the limitations of the EDUBlogs system.
