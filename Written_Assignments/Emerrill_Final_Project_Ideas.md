## Idea 1 : Personal Portfolio Website

Since roughly 2014 I have used the Wordpress site <a href='ethanmerrill.com'>ethanmerrill.com</a> as my personal site. I would like to have a site which is far more customized and showcases some web development expertise. I would also like to experiment with a new type of site navigation which uses a force directed graph to connect pages in a visual web. 

### Audience:
The audience for this site would be potential employers and clients of mine in the coming years.

On my existing site I post text, photos, and videos. Additional capability to visualize 3d model files such as STLs would be great as well. 
### Risks/Limitations/Concerns:
My ideal website is quite ambitious and beyond my current technical capabilities. I would like to use this capstone to push myself, however I will need to be mindful of setting an achievable final product.
